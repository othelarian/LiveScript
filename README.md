# LiveScript

NOTE: this is an alternative version, trying to bring some new features (see below for more information).

LiveScript is a language which compiles to JavaScript. It has a straightforward mapping to JavaScript and allows you to write expressive code devoid of repetitive boilerplate. While LiveScript adds many features to assist in functional style programming, it also has many improvements for object oriented and imperative programming.

Check out **[livescript.net](http://livescript.net)** for more information, examples, usage, and a language reference.

## Build Status

Official version build status:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gkz/LiveScript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gkz/LiveScript)

## Install

Have Node.js installed. `sudo npm install -g livescript`

After, run `lsc -h` for more information.

## Alternative modifications

### Moving from Makefile to full npm

The official version of LiveScript uses a makefile to compile the lib. The first idea behind the alternative is to remove the makefile dependency and to switch for a full node/npm tooling.
